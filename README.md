## Introduction
<p>
The clubs sign trainers and physios to their staff and fighters to their rosters. It is up to the manager to oversee training, tactics and to select fighters for each match. He is expected to keep up morale, direction and team cohesion.
</p>
<p>
Clubs must provide training facilities, a youth academy and a stadium. The martial field dimension limits are 50-60 meters wide and 90-110 meters long. Three distinctly marked rings with a 5-6 meter radius are equally spaced in the martial field.
</p>
<p>
Live scoring and data is available to the managers allowing them to take informed decisions. The best managers make it seem there's 4 fighters on their team.

## Match
<p>
A match is between two clubs. Each club fields 3 fighters, one for each contest: left ring, right ring and center ring. Each fighter can not leave the designated ring area for more than 20 seconds. Doing so results in a disqualification for that fighter. In case his opponent is outside the ring as well, regardless of how long, they both get reset in the center of the ring.
</p>

### Clock
<p>
Only the center ring has time-outs in any case of referee intervention. The other rings share the center´s clock.
</p>

### Scoring
<p>
The standard 10-point, must score, system is employed across three 5 minute rounds. A finish occurs by a KO/TKO, submission, doctor stoppage or decision. After getting a finish in the left or right rings, the fighter becomes available as a substitute. If a finish occurs in the center ring, the finished fighter is substituted by the first available substitution, given the club has any, otherwise the match ends. 
Each contest is scored by three judges. After the allotted time the club that has more fighters unfinished is awarded center ring for 2 points. If fighter material is equal the match goes to the judges' cards. 
</p>

<p>
Points are given for the outcome of each ring´s contest. In the center ring: 2 for a decision, 1 for a draw. In the left and right, 1 for a victory, 0 for a draw. For finishing, in the center: 3 points, in the left and right: 1 point. The highest amount of points a club can take out of a match is 3.

### Outcome examples

```
    Scough finishes left ring giving them a substitution and a point.
    The other contests haven't seen a finish when the clock runs out.
    Fighter material goes to Scough, having 3 fighters unfinished against 2.
    That awards center ring to Scough, giving them 2 points
      The final score is 3-0 for Scough.
```

```
    The clock runs out with no finishes.
    Limmage wins the decision in the right ring, scoring a point.
    Center and left ring both end in draws. This awards a point for each club.
      The final score is 2-1 for Limmage.
```

```
    The contest in the center ends in an early finish for Scough, awarding
    them three points and ending the match.
      The final score is 3-0 for Limmage.
```
```
    Scough gets the finish in the left and right followed by the center awarding
    1 point each for left and right and 3 for the center. However, the cap for 
    points earned in a match is 3.
      The final score is 3-0 for Limmage.
