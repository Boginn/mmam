The clubs sign trainers and physios to their staff and fighters to their rosters. It is up to the manager to oversee training, tactics and to select fighters for each match. He is expected to keep up morale, direction and team cohesion.
</p>
<p>
Clubs must provide training facilities, a youth academy and a stadium. The martial field dimension limits are 50-60 meters wide and 90-110 meters long. Three distinctly marked rings with a 5-6 meter radius are equally spaced in the martial field.
</p>

<p>
A match is between two clubs. Each club fields 3 fighters, one for each contest: left ring, right ring and center ring. Each fighter can not leave the designated ring area for more than 20 seconds. Doing so results in a disqualification for that fighter. In case his opponent is outside the ring as well, regardless of how long, they get reset in the center of the ring.
</p>

<p>
The standard 10-point must score system is employed across three 5 minute rounds. A finish occurs by KO/TKO, Submission, Doctor Stoppage or by a decision. A unanimous score in a ring after 2 rounds of 20-16 or lower results in a decision. After a finish in the left or right rings, the winning fighter becomes available as a substitute. If a finish occurs in the center ring, the finished fighter is substituted by the first available substitution given the club has any, otherwise the match ends. 
Each contest is scored by three judges. If the match ends in a decision, the left and right ring are decided by the judges' cards. The club that has more fighters unfinished is awarded center ring, otherwise, if equal, it goes to the judges' card.
</p>

<p>
Score is given for the outcome of each ring´s contest. In the center ring, three for victory, one for a draw. In the left and right, one for a victory, zero for a draw.
</p>

<p>
Only the center ring has time-outs in any case of referee intervention. The other rings share the center´s clock.

### Outcome examples
```
Club A finishes left ring giving them a substitution and a point.
    The contest in the center runs out to a decision, ending the match.
    Club B wins the decision in the right ring, scoring a point.
    Club B also wins the decision in the center ring but it is irrelevant
    since club A has more unfinished fighters so they win center ring for
    three points.
      The final score is 4-1 for Club A.
```

```

```

```

<p>
Live scoring and data is available to the managers allowing them to take informed decisions. The best managers make it seem there's 4 fighters on their team.
