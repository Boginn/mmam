// TODOS
  I should go through and leave notes
  
    make fighters chins take permanent daamge after knockouts
    make fighters power fluctuate a bit according to morale, form and training


  
// BUGS
    clicking on v-progress-linear changes the health,
    (handy to have atm for debugging)
        => fix, switch from v-model to :value. 


    commitFighterForm is wtf
    was a bug where this.cards.foreach fd up
    hard to reproduce when my team is so much better
    this means the only form updates are when there's a finish(works in simMatch too)



// SPECIFIC
functionality:
    pressing back things
        delete the match from the schedule? already done maybe
        if you go to a match that's been played you go to '/'
        to look at that match, see it in the archives

        you're in a match an press back....
tweaks:
   
   
implement:
    screen to pick team to manage
  
    fixture:
        click on 

        

    match:


 
        manager might be able to ask fighters to specifically strike or grapple but it's
        ultimately up to the fighters. fighters, in most situations, will follow other 
        instructions well however.

        a flash knockout can occur
            if (roll 100 + momentum? 2 + morale? 2 + form? 2) bigger than 100
            then flash knockout occurs

            momentum triggers -- 
                finishing someone gives momentum hm only if in center ring
