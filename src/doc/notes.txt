// TODOS
    readme could use more sections, transform to manual
   
    
  I should go through and leave notes
  
    make fighters chins take permanent daamge after knockouts
    make fighters power fluctuate a bit according to morale, form and training


  
// BUGS
    clicking on v-progress-linear changes the health,
    (handy to have atm for debugging)
        => fix, switch from v-model to :value. 

    when in any squad, the link squad does nothing but should go to selected club's squad




// SPECIFIC
functionality:
    pressing back things
        partially dealt with by keeping everything necessary for Match.vue in the state,
        it still has bugs
tweaks:
   
   
implement:
    screen to pick team to manage
  
    fixture:
        click on 

        

    match:


 
        manager might be able to ask fighters to specifically strike or grapple but it's
        ultimately up to the fighters. fighters, in most situations, will follow other 
        instructions well however.

        a flash knockout can occur
            if (roll 100 + momentum? 2 + morale? 2 + form? 2) bigger than 100
            then flash knockout occurs

            momentum triggers -- 
                finishing someone gives momentum hm only if in center ring

      

last time:
    

    we had lots of refactors, grapples and strikes ready to be made
    should probably customize the rest of the fighters
    get the AI choosing based on form
    introduce morale

    lots of talmbout morale+form+momentum being boosters

    loads of stuff added in state to start saving more to be able to
    tackle the problem of pressing back/navigation
    keep watch for things to being reset properly befoer next match

    might be sweet to start working on bringin color from the team
    could also make an intro screen at this point
    then fix the look of schedule

    work on submission logic, right now it;s too many messages of the attempt
    check for balance
