// TODOS
    readme could use more sections, transform to manual
   
    
  I should go through and leave notes
  
    make fighters chins take permanent daamge after knockouts
    make fighters power fluctuate a bit according to morale, form and training


  
// BUGS
    clicking on v-progress-linear changes the health,
    (handy to have atm for debugging)
        => fix, switch from v-model to :value. 

    when in any squad, the link squad does nothing but should go to selected club's squad

    schedule -> archive Cannot read property 0 of undefined

   ! points in league table, account for finish vs against





// SPECIFIC
functionality:
    pressing back things
        partially dealt with by keeping everything necessary for Match.vue in the state,
        it still has bugs
tweaks:
   
   
implement:
   
    ai:
            get clubs thinking
            get the AI choosing based on form

    match:


        submissions should be harder to complete the longer the fight goes on
            sweatfactor
            mitigated a bit by workrate and stamina
 
        manager might be able to ask fighters to specifically strike or grapple but it's
        ultimately up to the fighters. fighters, in most situations, will follow other 
        instructions well however.

        a flash knockout can occur
            if (roll 100 + momentum? 2 + morale? 2 + form? 2) bigger than 100
            then flash knockout occurs

            momentum triggers -- 
                finishing someone gives momentum hm only if in center ring

      

last time:

think finishes are countiong twice for the slectedClub

   there is no bad stuff for having no stamina yet!

    cool if more reckless/attacking instructions lead to spending
    more stamina and versa


    introduce morale
    lots of talmbout morale+form+momentum being boosters

    maybe getOn uses action count and makes sure there aren't completely dead rounds
    except very rarely. could use for each ring to spread the action out
