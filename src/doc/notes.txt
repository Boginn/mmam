// TODOS
    readme could use more sections, transform to manual
   
    
  I should go through and leave notes
  
    make fighters chins take permanent daamge after knockouts
    make fighters power fluctuate a bit according to morale, form and training


  
// BUGS
    clicking on v-progress-linear changes the health,
    (handy to have atm for debugging)
        => fix, switch from v-model to :value. 

    when in any squad, the link squad does nothing but should go to selected club's squad




// SPECIFIC
functionality:
    pressing back things
        partially dealt with by keeping everything necessary for Match.vue in the state,
        it still has bugs

    match:


 
        manager might be able to ask fighters to specifically strike or grapple but it's
        ultimately up to the fighters. fighters, in most situations, will follow other 
        instructions well however.

        a flash knockout can occur
            if (roll 100 + momentum? 2 + morale? 2 + form? 2) bigger than 100
            then flash knockout occurs

            momentum triggers -- 
                finishing someone gives momentum hm only if in center ring

      

last time:
    

    we had lots of refactors, grapples and strikes ready to be made
    should probably customize the rest of the fighters
    get the AI choosing based on form

    introduce morale
    lots of talmbout morale+form+momentum being boosters

    lets follow through on the asset/dots/ stuff. move the js into a component
    and try to display them moving buddies
    amazing to get dots in the rings moving randomly in relation to each other
    stop if grappling etc
    colored for each team ofc
    messagesForRings change to object to hold color, put banner on the side of
    the relevant club with the ringmessage and make the dots move meanwhile
