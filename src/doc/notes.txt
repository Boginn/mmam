    match:


 
        manager might be able to ask fighters to specifically strike or grapple but it's
        ultimately up to the fighters. fighters, in most situations, will follow other 
        instructions well however.

        a flash knockout can occur
            if (roll 100 + momentum? 2 + morale? 2 + form? 2) bigger than 100
            then flash knockout occurs

            momentum triggers -- 
                finishing someone gives momentum hm only if in center ring

      

last time:
    

    we had lots of refactors, grapples and strikes ready to be made
    should probably customize the rest of the fighters
    get the AI choosing based on form
    introduce morale

    lots of talk bout morale+form+momentum being boosters
