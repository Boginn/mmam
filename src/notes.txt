match:
    go through each check vs check to see disrepancies,
    MAKE SURE to balance all fighters to 10


    
    ahhhh crucial, give fighters 
    rating from 3.0-10.0
    having a good rating in the last five contests
    indicates good form 
    form can come into play for initiative perhaps

    how about the form is last 6 or so rounds
    + number of finishes this season
    Fighter L W W L L W (5)

        after landing a good successfull takedown 
            give momentum to controling fighter
            if other fighter gets initiative it is used to get up
        

        momentum triggers -- finishing someone gives momentum hm only if in center ring
        judges need to get activity numbers
        write actions








   
  
    



// DREAMS
each fighter has a potential range for each 
stat/attribute/instruction/trainingfocuses

manager can try to instruct the fighter to use
certain moves, limbs and style.

(judges look at truePoints and depending on 
retention and other judging.attributes gives
a card.(done) )
assistant manager also does this and gives his
points to the manager

approach unsigned players for a contract, have
transfers bewteen clubs etc

training, staff, assistant manager that shows stats
and judges a ring

youth developement news item, offers a pool of fighters
coaches give their opinion based on judging potential ability
etc
