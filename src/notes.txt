// BUGS
    didnt get the judgse card after a decision (normally, not defaultmode)

    seems to only happen when both left and right have been finished




// SPECIFIC
functionality:
    pressing back things
        delete the match from the schedule? already done maybe
        if you go to a match that's been played you go to '/'
        to look at that match, see it in the archives
tweaks:
    physical.explosiveness added, adjust singleLeg!
implement:
    screen to pick team to manage
    news item, youve been hired
    spruce up squad view, add condition


match:

    after landing a good successfull takedown 
        give momentum to controling fighter
        if other fighter gets initiative it is used to get up
    

    momentum triggers -- finishing someone gives momentum hm only if in center ring
    judges need to get activity numbers
    write actions








   
  
    



// DREAMS
each fighter has a potential range for each 
stat/attribute/instruction/trainingfocuses

manager can try to instruct the fighter to use
certain moves, limbs and style.

(judges look at truePoints and depending on 
retention and other judging.attributes gives
a card.(done) )
assistant manager also does this and gives his
points to the manager

approach unsigned players for a contract, have
transfers bewteen clubs etc

training, staff, assistant manager that shows stats
and judges a ring

youth developement news item, offers a pool of fighters
coaches give their opinion based on judging potential ability
etc
