// TODOS
  I should go through and leave notes ASAP
  hold off on refactoring alon the way
  refrain from spending too much time on match engine for the time being
  focus on getting all the data flow smooth first

  make a fixtureEngine, getPostMatch and getFixtures functions

  make the modal for speccing fighters in a match a components
  its in Overview, Bench and MatchTactics
  
// BUGS





// SPECIFIC
functionality:
    pressing back things
        delete the match from the schedule? already done maybe
        if you go to a match that's been played you go to '/'
        to look at that match, see it in the archives

        you're in a match an press back....
tweaks:
   
implement:
    screen to pick team to manage
  
    fixture:
        click on 

    match:
        go through each check vs check to see disrepancies, (game balance)
        MAKE SURE to balance all fighters to 10


        
        ahhhh crucial, 
        having a good rating in the last five contests
        indicates good form 
        form can come into play for initiative perhaps

        how about the form is last 6 or so rounds
        + number of finishes this season
        Fighter L W W L L W (5)

            after landing a good successfull takedown 
                give momentum to controling fighter
                if other fighter gets initiative it is used to get up
            

            momentum triggers -- finishing someone gives momentum hm only if in center ring
            judges need to get activity numbers
            write actions


last time:
    was working on passing the points of the fighers to count their form
    displaying staff on the Details comopnent, make coach judge rounds
    and display their scoring in details 
    // in archiveMatch
    // well at the moment this doesnt give me win loss of rounds
    // lets make something in decisionEngine to getDetailedJudgesCards






   
  features:
        remember the ring isnt a cage (scrap this?)
            any way to implement leaving the cage?
            non of these really work with the engine
        
                dq if >20secs outside
                if both outside after time, reset in middle
            
    



// DREAMS

certain moves, limbs and style.

approach unsigned players for a contract, have
transfers bewteen clubs etc

training, staff, assistant manager that shows stats
and judges a ring

youth developement news item, offers a pool of fighters

etc
