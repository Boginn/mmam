    ahhhh crucial, 
    having a good rating in the last five contests
    indicates good form 
    form can come into play for initiative perhaps

    how about the form is last 6 or so rounds
    + number of finishes this season
    Fighter L W W L L W (5)

        after landing a good successfull takedown 
            give momentum to controling fighter
            if other fighter gets initiative it is used to get up
        

        momentum triggers -- finishing someone gives momentum hm only if in center ring
        judges need to get activity numbers
        write actions


last time:
    was working on passing the points of the fighers to count their form
    displaying staff on the Details comopnent, make coach judge rounds
    and display their scoring in details 






   
  features:
        remember the ring isnt a cage (scrap this?)
            any way to implement leaving the cage?
            non of these really work with the engine
        
                dq if >20secs outside
                if both outside after time, reset in middle
            
    



// DREAMS
each fighter has a potential range for each 
stat/attribute/instruction/trainingfocuses

manager can try to instruct the fighter to use
certain moves, limbs and style.

(judges look at truePoints and depending on 
retention and other judging.attributes gives
a card.(done) )
assistant manager also does this and gives his
points to the manager

approach unsigned players for a contract, have
transfers bewteen clubs etc

training, staff, assistant manager that shows stats
and judges a ring

youth developement news item, offers a pool of fighters
coaches give their opinion based on judging potential ability
etc
